# Hallo-Wereld
My first repository

Decided to learn to programme properly after all these years of "just barely able to hack it" in University. 
Started with Python (12DEC2015)
Then Raspberry Pi (20DEC2015)
Going into C and C++ (15JAN2016) 
Arduino UNO (15JAN2016)
Git and GitBash (31JAN2016)
R Programming (05FEB2016)

Slow and steady does it. 

As of 01Feb2016: Started  2 more courses on Coursera ("Data Scientist's Toolbox" and "R programming"). For the moment I am only auditing the course (i.e. read the notes, watch the lectures, no certification). On week 2 of D.S.T and week 1 of R.P. 

As of 06Feb2016: nearly completed (3 more videos, and one coursework to submit) Coursera's Arduino and C++ programming course. 
Will be staring the second part "Arduino Interfacing Course" by the same University and lecturer. Considering to purchase the certificate.
