# Hallo-Wereld
My first repository

Decided to learn to programme properly after all these years of "just barely able to hack it" in University. 
Started with Python in 12 Dec 2015
Then Raspberry Pi (20 Dec 2015)
Going into C and C++ (15 January 2016) 
Arduino UNO (also 15 Jan 2016)

Slow and steady does it.
