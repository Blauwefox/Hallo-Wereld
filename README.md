# Hallo-Wereld
My first repository

Decided to learn to programme properly after all these years of "just barely able to hack it" in University. 
Started with Python (12DEC2015)
Then Raspberry Pi (20DEC2015)
Going into C and C++ (15JAN2016) 
Arduino UNO (15JAN2016)
Git and GitBash (31JAN2016)
R Programming (05FEB2016)

Slow and steady does it. 

As of 01Feb2016: Started  2 more courses on Coursera ("Data Scientist's Toolbox" and "R programming"). For the moment I am only auditing the course (i.e. read the notes, watch the lectures, no certification). On week 2 of D.S.T and week 1 of R.P. 

As of 06Feb2016: nearly completed (3 more videos, and one coursework to submit) Coursera's Arduino and C++ programming course. 
Will be staring the second part "Arduino Interfacing Course" by the same University and lecturer. Considering to purchase the certificate. 

Hiatus of 9 months, due to unexpected death in the family, and having to undergo surgery at end of February with long recovery time. In november 2016, started "The complete SQL bootcamp course" on Udemy with good progress. Will continue work on arduino and Pi projects in due course. New repository for SQL created on 19 DEC 2016 with codes written for the course
